# Security model

!!! warning "Interactive sessions are not per-command policy gates"
    Per-action policy and approval decisions apply to calls routed through the
    control plane's governed tool APIs (REST, MCP, dashboard shell/file/code
    controls, and SDK adapters). The interactive terminal, optional browser IDE
    (code-server), and commands started directly inside a sandbox receive
    sandbox, network, and resource controls plus terminal recording / Chronicle
    open-close for IDE sessions, but Runeward does not intercept each shell
    command or IDE keystroke for a policy verdict. Use governed tool calls when
    individual command approval and signed verdict evidence are required.

runeward's job is to reduce the blast radius of an autonomous agent. Knowing what
it does — and does not — protect against is essential to using it safely.

For **reporting vulnerabilities**, see
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/Runewardd/runeward/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
Please disclose privately; do not open a public issue.

## What runeward provides

- **Isolation.** Each cell runs in a container (Docker/Podman) or Pod (Kubernetes)
  with its own workspace. Docker cells are hardened by default: all Linux
  capabilities dropped, `no-new-privileges`, a `--pids-limit`, and default
  memory/CPU ceilings (overridable via `RUNEWARD_SANDBOX_MEMORY`,
  `RUNEWARD_SANDBOX_CPUS`, `RUNEWARD_SANDBOX_PIDS`; set to `0` to disable).
  Setting `host.read_only = true` mounts the root filesystem read-only (with a
  writable `/tmp` and the writable workspace) on both Docker and Kubernetes.
  `host.seccomp` / `host.apparmor` pin a seccomp/AppArmor profile (Docker
  `--security-opt`; Kubernetes Localhost profiles), and Kubernetes pods default
  to the runtime's seccomp profile rather than Unconfined.
  A Charter can explicitly override an application image's entrypoint with
  `host.command`; Docker/Podman creation requires the process to remain alive
  across post-start checks before the Citadel is reported as running.
- **Control-plane authentication.** `runeward serve` binds `127.0.0.1` by
  default and refuses any non-loopback `--bind` unless authentication is set (an
  API token via `--token` / `RUNEWARD_API_TOKEN`, or an RBAC store). When set it
  is required on every request — REST, `/mcp`, the terminal WebSocket, and the
  dashboard. A non-loopback listener also refuses plaintext HTTP unless TLS is
  configured with `--tls-cert`/`--tls-key` or the operator explicitly passes
  `--allow-insecure-http` behind a trusted TLS-terminating proxy. Request bodies
  are size-capped to bound memory use.
- **RBAC / multi-principal auth.** Setting `RUNEWARD_AUTHZ_FILE` to a JSON store
  of principals (each with its own token, an allowed-profile glob list, and
  launch, approval-profile, and admin scopes) upgrades the single shared token to per-principal
  access: the server enforces which profiles a caller may launch and whether it
  may resolve approvals, and records the principal name as the audit actor.
  `/v1/whoami` reports honest `can_launch` / `can_approve` flags;
  `/v1/charters` and policy simulation are scoped to launchable Charters for
  non-admins. A principal has a resource-owning `tenant` and an independently
  attributed actor `name`; several agents can therefore collaborate without
  sharing one identity. Each Citadel records its owning tenant; a non-admin can see
  and act on only its tenant's Citadels (an ownership guard enforces this on every
  `/v1/citadels/{id}` route), while admins see all. The dashboard has an
  interactive token login (backed by `/v1/whoami`) that gates create/approve
  controls to what the caller is permitted; the static dashboard shell loads
  without a token so the login screen can render, but the API always requires
  one. Recovery snapshots are tenant-scoped and persisted. HTTP MCP uses the
  same per-request principal and ownership rules as REST; stdio MCP binds one
  process to the principal selected by `RUNEWARD_MCP_DEFAULT_TOKEN` or the
  credential saved by `runeward auth login`.
- **HTTP hardening.** Responses set `nosniff`, frame denial, no-referrer, and a
  restrictive Permissions Policy. API/MCP responses are no-store and use a
  deny-all content policy; dashboard assets use the explicit dashboard CSP.
- **OIDC authentication.** `RUNEWARD_OIDC_ISSUER` plus
  `RUNEWARD_OIDC_AUDIENCE` enables RS256 JWT verification from the provider's
  JWKS. Runeward maps only signed claims: `runeward_tenant`,
  `runeward_profiles`, `runeward_approval_profiles`,
  `runeward_can_approve`, and `runeward_admin`. Issuer, audience, expiry,
  not-before, algorithm, key id, and signature are checked. Non-loopback issuer
  and JWKS endpoints must use HTTPS.
- **Signed Cohort leases.** Claim returns a short-lived HMAC-signed
  `lease_token` bound to Cohort, task, actor, and expiry. Heartbeat returns a
  refreshed token; complete/fail require the current token. Listing a task never
  exposes its lease capability.
- **Durable state.** Cohort boards, snapshots, and provider-neutral Run records
  use private atomic state-file replacement. A run still marked active after a
  control-plane restart is closed as `interrupted` rather than appearing live.
- **Cost / token budgets.** Agents or Cohort workers report model usage to
  `POST /v1/citadels/{id}/usage`; usage accrues per Citadel and per Charter
  (surfaced in Prometheus and the Citadel view). A Charter's `rationing.max_tokens`
  / `rationing.max_cost_usd` caps are enforced fail-closed — once exceeded, further
  governed tool calls are denied.
- **Attributed approvals.** Resolving an approval records *who* decided it (the
  RBAC principal name, else `X-Runeward-Actor`, else the peer address) in the
  audit ledger.
- **Deny-by-default egress, enforced at L3 on both backends.** Network access is
  denied unless explicitly allowlisted. Cooperative mode points the sandbox at
  the proxy via `HTTP(S)_PROXY` (the host proxy requires a per-cell credential);
  strict mode (`network.enforce = "strict"`) enforces transparently at the
  kernel: on Kubernetes via an iptables init container + sidecar sharing the pod
  netns, and on Docker via a `NET_ADMIN` egress sidecar that owns the netns
  (the sandbox joins it with `--network container:…`). In strict mode all TCP is
  redirected through the proxy regardless of proxy env, so code that ignores it
  can't bypass the allowlist. The strict path also drops non-DNS UDP (blocking
  QUIC/HTTP3 bypass) and IPv6 egress; setting `RUNEWARD_DNS_RESOLVERS`
  (comma-separated IPs) additionally confines DNS (UDP+TCP :53) to those
  resolvers, closing DNS as a covert exfil channel.
- **Per-action policy and approvals.** `allow` / `deny` / `require-approval`
  verdicts, with human-in-the-loop gates for risky operations.
- **Guardrails.** Hard caps on wall-clock, exec count, egress requests, and
  token/spend budgets, plus retry-loop detection.
- **Tamper-evident audit.** An append-only, hash-chained, ed25519-signed ledger,
  independently verifiable offline. Events can also stream in real time to a
  webhook or file sink (`RUNEWARD_AUDIT_WEBHOOK_URL` / `RUNEWARD_AUDIT_FILE`)
  for SIEM ingestion, over a non-blocking queue that never stalls the ledger. A
  built-in anomaly detector flags novel egress targets, exec bursts, and denial
  spikes (`RUNEWARD_ANOMALY_*`).
- **Terminal session recording.** With `RUNEWARD_RECORD_TERMINALS=1`, governed
  terminal sessions are captured as asciinema v2 casts under the state dir and
  can be replayed with `runeward replay` as part of the audit trail.
- **Read-only Live chat.** Conversation turns are opt-in messages published by
  an agent harness, not automatic capture of private agent UI text. Runeward
  bounds each Citadel's in-memory history, applies declared-secret and
  credential-pattern redaction, strips terminal controls, and streams through
  an ownership-checked, same-origin WebSocket using a short-lived scoped ticket.
  The observer socket accepts no application input. Live chat is operational
  visibility; the signed Chronicle remains the authoritative action evidence.
- **No host mounts.** `copy_from` copies into the sandbox; the host tree is never
  mounted. Request-time overrides are administrator-only. Set
  `RUNEWARD_COPY_FROM_ROOTS` (a colon-separated allowlist) to confine which host
  directories `copy_from` may read; sources outside the roots fail creation.
- **Kubernetes multi-tenancy.** The managed namespace carries Pod Security
  Admission labels (`RUNEWARD_K8S_PSA_ENFORCE`, or the chart's
  `podSecurityStandard`), Citadel containers always drop `ALL` capabilities and
  disable privilege escalation, and an optional default-deny NetworkPolicy
  (DNS-only egress) isolates Citadel pods (`RUNEWARD_K8S_NETWORK_POLICY`, or the
  chart's `networkPolicy.enabled`) so cells can't reach each other or the control
  plane laterally.
- **Admission enforcement defaults.** The validating ClusterPolicy webhook is
  fail-closed (`failurePolicy: Fail`) so webhook outages block admission for
  governed resources. The mutating default-profile webhook is best-effort
  (`failurePolicy: Ignore`) and only fills missing `spec.profile`.
- **Supply-chain assurance.** Releases are cosign-signed (keyless) with SBOMs,
  and CI runs SAST (gosec, CodeQL), dependency/vuln scanning (govulncheck, Trivy),
  per-image CVE scans, and a DAST baseline, with Dependabot keeping dependencies
  current.

## In scope (please report)

- Citadel escape from a cell to the host or another cell.
- Bypass of the egress allowlist, policy engine, or approval gates.
- Audit-ledger forgery or silent tampering that verification would miss.
- Path traversal / writes outside the intended workspace (e.g. tar-slip).
- Auth/authorization flaws in the REST API, WebSocket terminal, browser IDE
  proxy, or admission webhook.
- Secret leakage in logs, the ledger, or the dashboard.

## Operator responsibility (out of scope)

- Security of the container runtime, host kernel, and Kubernetes cluster — keep
  them patched.
- Trustworthiness of images referenced by Charters and of the agents/CLIs you run
  inside a cell.
- Secrets you place in Charters; runeward redacts *declared* secret values from
  the ledger and additionally masks common credential shapes (API keys, bearer
  tokens, PEM keys, `password=`/`token=` pairs) wherever they appear, but
  pattern matching is best-effort and can't catch every custom format.
- Network exposure of `runeward serve`. It binds `127.0.0.1` and requires an API
  token before any non-loopback bind, but you still choose the token strength,
  terminate TLS appropriately, and configure static RBAC or OIDC rather than a
  shared token for team deployments.
- Denial of service from workloads you explicitly grant large resource limits.

## Operational notes

!!! warning "One writer per ledger"
    The audit ledger is single-writer, protected by a file lock. Give each running
    instance its own `RUNEWARD_STATE_DIR`. Two processes sharing one ledger produce
    out-of-order/duplicate records, permanently breaking the hash chain so
    verification reports tampering.

!!! note "Same-origin WebSocket"
    The dashboard terminal WebSocket enforces a same-origin check to prevent
    cross-site hijacking, and state-changing REST requests reject mismatched
    browser `Origin`s. Per-IP rate limiting defaults to 50 requests/sec; tune
    `RUNEWARD_RATE_LIMIT` or explicitly set it to `off` for trusted benchmarks.
    Front the control plane with TLS in production.

!!! note "Experimental browser IDE"
    With `RUNEWARD_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_IDE=1` and Charter `[ide] enabled`, serve
    reverse-proxies in-cell code-server. That session is workspace-equivalent
    interactive access (not per-keystroke policy). Cursor/Claude Desktop/Codex
    GUIs are not embedded; GitHub Copilot is not first-class on code-server
    (Open VSX). Details and limits: [Browser IDE](browser-ide.md).

runeward is defense-in-depth, not a hard isolation boundary. Its default
container backend shares the host kernel, so a determined escape via a kernel or
runtime vulnerability is possible. For untrusted or adversarial workloads, add
VM-grade isolation by setting `host.runtime_class` in the profile to a
sandboxed runtime. On Kubernetes this maps to `runtimeClassName` (e.g. `gvisor`
or `kata`); on Docker it maps to `docker run --runtime` (e.g. `runsc` for
gVisor, or `kata-runtime`). The runtime must first be installed and registered
with your engine — runeward does not install it, and a name the engine doesn't
recognize fails cell creation rather than silently falling back to the
shared-kernel runtime. `runeward runtime check` probes Docker and Kubernetes for
registered `runsc`/`kata` runtimes and `runeward runtime guide` prints the setup
steps. For the strictest cases, also use a disposable host.
runeward's sweet spot is governing a cooperative-but-fallible agent, not caging
code whose goal is to break out.
